          <p>Hello, friends! My name is Aly Beck. I love coffee, chocolate, and have a knack for procrastinating. 
            I currently reside in the lovely land of Ope (The Midwest) with my hubs and two tiny humans. 
            Where I got started: Many don't know this, but my biggest writing inspiration was my great Aunt S. At the age of 39, she started her writing career and by the age of 96 (yeah, 96) she published her final book before passing away. For years, I wanted to be just like her. And we'll, on November 10th of 2021, I made that dream come true with my debut, Web of Lies.But even before that, my dream started on Wattpad, where I published my very first books (they're still there. Horribly written, but there.) This writing journey has been so rewarding and has brought me here, to all of you.

        <p>“I *inhaled* this book. I have no other words for it. From the very beginning, I was hooked and I had to drag myself away to do the adult things I should be doing instead.”</p>
        <p>“This book was phenomenal! Hands down, one of the best books for 2022!”</p>

        <p>"I adored this second half of River’s story. It is easily worth more than five stars. I cannot even begin to put into words how much I loved the duet. Book one broke me, and book two was everything I needed to rebuild my heart."</p>
        <p>"Wow! This was an incredible ending to wrap up this fantastic duet which was full of angsty heartbreaking drama. I’ve felt joy, frustration and sadness and everything in between."</p>
        <p>"OMG what a rollercoaster this made me laugh cry and fall in love with certain characters. The conclusion to the story was amazing."</p>
